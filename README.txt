Other notes or comments to the grader:

1)The input .csv format is the same as the samples provided
in the prompt on Canvas

2)If a .csv file fails to load, anything up
until the point it fails will still be loaded. Once the user
fixes the errors in the .csv file they can reload it and
the data that is already there will be overwritten.

Bug Report: n/a

Possible Additions: 

1) Make it so user can choose many individual files to import
rather than just a directory

2) May want to change naming convention so that leading and
trailing whitespace is trimmed: for example, right now "A"
and "A  " are counted as different IDs, but look similar on
the GUI.

3) Consider adding additional types of reports or adding
new ways to change data through the GUI: for example, maybe
a report that uses all data that has been recorded rather
than restricting to a given year or month.

4) Could add option to print all the month reports for a
given year to files, rather than having to select each one
individually
